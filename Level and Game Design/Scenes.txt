Main task: Steal the plans
To complete this main task, the player needs to accomplish several sub-tasks:
-Escape the bedroom
-Find the safe
-Find the combination to the safe
-Escape the building

Major Task: Escape the bedroom without raising the alarm
Purpose:
This will teach the player how to (a) look around the room for things to interact with, (b) look inside items for other items, (c) equip items, and (d) traverse the world.
Obstacles:
-The door is locked
-You’re not dressed for the party
Tasks to complete:
-Find key in nightstand
-Find suit/gown in closet
-Equip suit/gown
-Leave bedroom
Notes:
-Having both a suit and a gown in the closet could be a way for the player to choose the gender of the main character. We could even change various NPC interactions based on the character’s gender.

Major Task: Search the upstairs office for anything valuable
Purpose:
Another simpler challenge for the burglar without any guests to deal with
Obstacles:
- There's a password protected computer
- The password is hidden somewhere in the room (there will be a piece of artwork that has a big word written within it)
- Once you are in the computer, there will be some banking passwords that you can steal
- There's also a USB plugged into the computer that you can take  

Major Task: Find the Safe
Purpose:
To familiarize the player with the world.
Obstacles:
-The safe is hidden in some room
-Searching will arouse suspicion from other party-goers
-The butler is blocking the top of the stairs
Tasks to complete:
-Get downstairs
-Find the correct room
-Clear the room of guests and search the room
Notes:
-We could put a possible hiding place in several different rooms, but only the third room fully checked will contain the safe. We could have an int in the game state which tracks how many potential hiding places have been opened, and only reveal the safe (and set the safe’s location) when that number has reached a certain point.

Major Task: Escape the party (through the foyer)
Purpose:
Head to safety, end the game, tally score
Obstacles:
- You have to talk to the host as you leave
- You have to take the party favor he gives you on the way out, but be careful not to reveal all the stolen items in your pockets as you take the gift.
Tasks:
- Accept the party favor. Put it in a pocket that isn't carrying any other stolen items.
- Distract the host momentarily and make a quick move towards the door.

Minor Task: Take the book signed by Dr. Suess from Bedroom 2
Purpose: One more thing to steal
Obstacles:
- None. Still very early in game, so pretty easy.

Minor Task: Get downstairs
Purpose:
To keep part of the world inaccessible until the player is more comfortable with the game. This keeps the player from getting overwhelmed.
Obstacles:
-The shrewd butler is blocking the top of the stairs. If he sees you, he’ll recognize you and raise the alarm.
Tasks to complete:
-Find that cute little maid the butler has a crush on?
Notes:
-There are all sorts of possibilities for distracting butlers. Who knows, maybe we frame him for murder?
