Text-Based Adventure Game

Main task: Steal the plans
To complete this main task, the player needs to accomplish several sub-tasks:
-Escape the bedroom
-Find the safe
-Find the combination to the safe
-Escape the building

Major Task: Escape the bedroom without raising the alarm
Purpose:
This will teach the player how to (a) look around the room for things to interact with, (b) look inside items for other items, (c) equip items, and (d) traverse the world.
Obstacles:
-The door is locked
-You’re not dressed for the party
Tasks to complete:
-Find key in nightstand
-Find suit/gown in closet
-Equip suit/gown
-Leave bedroom
Notes:
-Having both a suit and a gown in the closet could be a way for the player to choose the gender of the main character. We could even change various NPC interactions based on the character’s gender.

Major Task: Find the Safe
Purpose:
To familiarize the player with the world.
Obstacles:
-The safe is hidden in some room
-Searching will arouse suspicion from other party-goers
-The butler is blocking the top of the stairs
Tasks to complete:
-Get downstairs
-Find the correct room
-Clear the room of guests and search the room
Notes:
-We could put a possible hiding place in several different rooms, but only the third room fully checked will contain the safe. We could have an int in the game state which tracks how many potential hiding places have been opened, and only reveal the safe (and set the safe’s location) when that number has reached a certain point.

Minor Task: Get downstairs
Purpose:
To keep part of the world inaccessible until the player is more comfortable with the game. This keeps the player from getting overwhelmed.
Obstacles:
-The shrewd butler is blocking the top of the stairs. If he sees you, he’ll recognize you and raise the alarm.
Tasks to complete:
-Find that cute little maid the butler has a crush on?
Notes:
-There are all sorts of possibilities for distracting butlers. Who knows, maybe we frame him for murder?
