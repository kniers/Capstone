The text parser expects a standard string and a pointer to an empty Command object.

The parser will deposit the action, direct object, and indirect object, and direction into the
appropriate slots of the Command object. Any unused object slots will be NULL. If there's no
verb, the verb will say "nope".

The parser will set the status of the Command object to 0 if the syntax is valid, and
to 1 if the syntax is invalid. Do not use the command if the status is 1.

The parser will print out the appropriate error message for syntax errors.

The parser will not guarantee a Command object that makes sense. The command "eat table"
will be considered correct by the parser. Non-syntax errors will be handled by the items.

The parser accepts command in the following formats:
/****************************************
 * Valid command formats *
 * (1) <verb> <dirObj>
 * Example: "eat taco"
 * (2) <dirObj>
 * Example: "taco" (describes taco)
 * (3) <verb> <dirObj> (preposition) <indObj>
 * Example: "show taco to Alice"
 * (4) <verb> <indObj> <dirObj>
 * Example: "give Alice taco"
 * (5) <direction>
 * Example: "north"
 * (6) <verb> <direction>
 * Example: "go north"
 * (7) <direction> <dirObj>
 * Example: "north door"
 * (8) <verb> <direction> <dirObj>
 * Example: "open north door"
 * (9) <verb> <direction> <dirObj> (prep) <indObj>
 * Example: "open north door with key"
****************************************/
Note that for a command <verb> <item> <item>, the first item will always be considered as the
indirect object. If there's a situation where that's incorrect, let me know.

Let me know if there are any other variations of commands I haven't noticed, and I'll get those coded.
