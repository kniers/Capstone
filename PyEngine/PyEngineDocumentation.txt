PyEngine

PyEngine is a singleton class that holds all the Room and Item objects. When the game starts up, the PyEngine loads all the .py files in the Content directory and subdirectories. It implements a set of C++ and Python APIs to access the game content. Room and Item classes defined after all the engine stuff in the document.

C++ ACCESSORS

Verbs
	string getVerb(string verb)
		Get a verb that has been defined by the Python setVerbs() function. Takes in a verb name or synonym and returns the official version of the verb

Score
	long getScore()
		Get game score

	void setScore(long newScore)
		Set the games score. No way to increment score, so get the score, add to it, then set it


Item
	Item* getItemByName(string itemName)
		Get an item based on the "name" property, no matter where the item is in the game

	Item* getItem(string item)
		Get an item where the input string matches the item name or any alias of the item, no matter where it is in the game. No defined way of handling items that have matching aliases

	bool inInventory(Item* itemToCheck)
		Helper function to check if an item is in the player's inventory

	vector<Item*>* getInventory()
		Get the player's inventory as a vector of Items. Can add or remove items

	vector<Item*>* getGlobalItems()
		Get the set of items that can be accessed from anywhere. Can add or remove items

	vector<Item*> getItemsInRoom(Room* room)
		Get the set of items in a given room. Gives a copy of the vector, not a pointer to it

	Item* getAccessibleItem(char* itemName)
		Get an item that the player has access to. Only returns an item in the current room, in the inventory, or globally accessible. ItemName can be the item's name or an alias for the item. Doesn't have a defined way of handling multiple items with the same alias.


Room
	Room* getRoomByName(string roomName)
		Get a room based on the "name" property, no matter where it is then the game

	Room* getCurrentRoom()
		Get the room the player is currently in

	string goToRoom(Room* room)
		Place the player in a new room. Returns the long or short description depending on if the player has been there before



PYTHON ACCESSORS
Include "import eng" in each file. Every API call is a function on the the eng module

Verbs
	None setVerbs(Dictionary verbs)
		Define a set of verbs and their synonyms for the parser to recognize. This function only adds verbs to the list, and it can be called multiple times to add more verbs

Score
	Number getScore()
		Get game score

	None setScore(Number newScore)
		Set the games score. No way to increment score, so get the score, add to it, then set it


Win/Loss

		Win the game. Nothing happens after this - breaks the main loop

	None loseGame()
		Lose the game. We haven't defined what happens yet


Item
	None setupItem(Item newItem)
		This is how the engine knows that an item exists. Make an instance of an item then send it to the engine

	Item getItemByName(String itemName)

	None addToInventory(Item itemToAdd)
		Add an item to the player's inventory

	None removeFromInventory(Item itemToRemove)
		Remove an item from the player's inventory

	Boolean inInventory(Item itemToCheck)
		Check if the player has an item in their inventory

		Get the room the player is currently in

	String goToRoom(Room room)
		Place the player in a new room. Return the long or short description depending on if the player has been there


ROOM CLASS
Room and Item classes are subject to change.
Rooms are Python objects, so they don't need anything special for Python APIs. C++ accessors are defined here

		Get the "name" property of a room

	string getLongDescription()
		Get the "longDesc" property of a room

	string getShortDescription()
		Get the "shortDesc" property of a room

	Room* doorTo(string roomName)
		Takes a room name, door name, or direction and returns a reference to the next room. Doors haven't been defined yet, but there will need to be a way of checking we can get through the door

	void dropItem(Item* item)
		Drop the item in the room. Removes it from player's inventory. It can be picked up later with "get" command

	bool hasDroppedItem(Item* item)
		Returns true if the player dropped the item in the room. It can always be picked up with "get"

	void pickupDroppedItem(Item* item)
		Pick up the item previously dropped by the player and add it to inventory. Bypass the "get" verb function


ITEM CLASS
Room and Item classes are subject to change.
Items are Python objects, so they don't need anything special for Python APIs. C++ accessors are defined here

	string getName()
		Get the "name" property of an item

	string getDescription()
		Get the "description" property of an item

	bool hasVerb(string verb)
		Check if the item has an action defined for a verb

	string runVerb(string verb)
		Run an item's verb function. Return the text that the verb function returned

	string runVerb(string verb, Item* indirectObject)

	bool hasAlias(string itemName)
		Returns true if itemName is an alias for the item

	bool isVisible()
		Returns true if the item is visible to the player. Visibility not defined yet so it always returns true.
